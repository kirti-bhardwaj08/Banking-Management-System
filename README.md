# Banking-Management-System
A robust, console-based Banking Management System developed in C++ that demonstrates core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and data persistence. This project simulates a real-world banking environment where users can manage their finances through a secure interface.

🚀 Key Features
* Account Personalization: Generates unique account numbers using a persistent bank code counter.

* Secure Authentication: Password-protected login system to ensure user data privacy.

* Data Persistence: Utilizes C++ File Streams (fstream) to save and load user profiles and transaction logs locally as .txt files.

* Transaction Tracking: Real-time tracking of deposits and withdrawals stored in a std::vector and synced to permanent storage.

* Dynamic UI: Uses ANSI escape codes to provide a color-coded, user-friendly terminal interface.

🛠 Technical Stack
Language: C++

 Concepts Used: 
 * Encapsulation: Private data members with public member functions.

* File I/O: Comprehensive use of ifstream and ofstream for database simulation.

* STL Containers: std::vector for managing dynamic transaction histories.
